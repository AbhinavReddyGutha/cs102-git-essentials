Summary:
1. GitHub is something which provides internet hosting for software development and version control using git. 
2. This helps us to work on projects on our own or among our collegues in an organised fashion. It can also be described as a social media platform for coders.
3. We can give access rights to public and also can be operated privately.
4. We can operate it either by github web interface, github desktop, or through commands.
5. In order to post any repository on our server through commands, firstly we need to create a new repository on our account.
6. Then we need to copy the ssh url generated to clone that repository and use the git clone <url> to clone our repository.
7. Then we can add new files or edit the existing files on the repository using our general linux commands(touch, cat).
8. Then we need to add the changes using git add command.
9. In order to push our changes, first we need to use git branch command and then use git push origin main.
10. If you have any doubt regarding how to proceed further during this process, use git status command.
11. You can use git pull command in order to bring the new changes happened to our file.
